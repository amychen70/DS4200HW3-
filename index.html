    <p>Hi my name is Mei Qi (Amy) Chen and I'm a Data Science and Business Administration 
        major at Northeastern University graduating in May 2028. I'm from Brooklyn, New York 
        and I'm interested in pursuing data analytics roles. Through my coursework and class 
        projects, I've developed skills in Python, R, and SQL where I use them to develop 
        data visualizations and data analysis.  </p>

    <p>My hobbies are traveling and photography. I like exploring new places and in my free 
        time I like to play videogames and hang out with my friends. I also like trying new 
        restaurants and food especially desserts and asian food. My favorite color is pink 
        and I love spicy food. Even though I don't sleep a lot, I love sleeping and would hope 
        that I can build a better schedule for it. I'm a more quiet and reserved person but my MBTI is ENTP. I would say I'm a more 
        introverted person but I love meeting new people. However, when I'm busy with work
        I tend to like being by myself more. </p>

    <p>Over the summer I took three summer classes (DS3500, CS3200, and INNO1201). Besides
        summer classes, I also completed a NUView experiential learning for Cambridge Mobile 
        Telematics where my team created an interactive data visualization for the company's
        job applicants. </p>
